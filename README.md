**Project : Data-driven strategic analysis of Olist e-commerce**

This project was conducted under the scope of the course ML - C52 

The guiding thread of this study is to add value to Olistâ€™s business using data analytics. The Folder is organized as follow :
The folders Data/E-commerce and Data/Marketing contains original sources files taken from Kaggle while the folder Data/Processed contains Processed data to suits our analysis.
Report.pdf describes exhaustively the process, the results and the conclusions of the research.
The different notebook.ipynb files in the main folder contain the source code used for the analysis.

**Prerequisites and Setup**

**Needed Libraries**:

I suppose that you have Anaconda installed on your computer in order to run python and jupyter notebooks. The following are necessary for the analysis :

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. sklearn
4. imblearn
5. Seaborn
6. googletrans
7. tqdm
   
Other libraries are just additional tools not really useful but rather convenient to ease and facilitate analysis. You may remove in the code those lines used to import them and it won't affect the the outcome.

**The data sets were taken from Kaggle:**
